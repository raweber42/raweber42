Hey! My name is Ralf, I'm a 26 year old Software Engineer born in Germany. Currently I am working as a Platform Engineer at [Cistec](https://www.cistec.com) in Zurich, Switzerland. </br>
I discovered my passion for coding in 2020 and have been coding daily ever since. As a Platform Engineer I help the Developers in our firm the deliver the best results possible without having to worry about how and where to deploy their work. I am constantly improving my skillset. On the side I have built an app for around 5000 tenants in Serbia with two friends where I wrote the backend for the app in Go and am responsible for our infrastructure.  </br>

My favorite technology: Kubernetes!
